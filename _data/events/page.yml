  description: |-
    In honour of LGBTQ+ History Month, the Dance Music Society invites you to come and celebrate the queer roots of modern dance music!

    We'll be celebrating disco and its many reverberations through electronic music and pop culture. There'll be disco new and old, anthems and deep cuts alike, through to italo-disco, Chicago house, 80s synthpop and beyond; expect some LGBTQ+ anthems in there too! Commemorating the vibes of Studio 54, The Loft, Paradise Garage, queer havens which acted as the formative sites of dance music culture. People of all genders and sexualities are invited to come and party in an inclusive atmosphere and be yourself

    Fierce outfits encouraged, think Studio 54 glam/NY Club Kids vibes - best look wins a litre of voddy

    Safe Space policy - disco and disrespect do not mix!
    Gender neutral toilets on site
