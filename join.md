All our events are open to members and non-members, and most are free. Becoming a paid member gives you a discount on all our paid events, and gives you a vote at all general society meetings, where we vote on amendments to our constitution and elect committee members. You will also receive a BLOGS membership card, which entitles you to discounts and promotions at our sponsor, CC Bloom’s.

To find out about events, {% include link.html link='newsletter' content='subscribe' %} to our mailing list to receive our weekly newsletter, or our {% include link.html link='facebook' content='Facebook Page' %} to be notified whenever we make an event. Society membership lasts until the next September unless stated otherwise. You can buy membership online from <a href="https://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/societies/society/blogs/"><abbr title="Edinburgh University Students' Association">EUSA</abbr>’s website</a>, or in person from the Treasurer at any of our main events.
