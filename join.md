All our events are open to members and non members and most are free. However becoming a paid member gives you discount on all our paid events, and gives you a vote at all general society meetings. You will also receive a membership card, which entitles you to promotions at this years sponsor, Chalkys Late Night Lounge.

Membership lasts till the next September unless stated otherwise. You can buy membership online from EUSA's website [here](https://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/societies/society/blogs/), or in person from the Treasurer at any of our main events.
