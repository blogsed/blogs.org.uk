Hello, and welcome to the BLOGS website!

We are the University of Edinburgh’s LGBT+ society, here to bring you awesome events including, but not limited to, chilled out chats, discussion events, trips to different LGBT+ spaces in other cities, informative talks, a bit of campaigning, nights out, as well as collaborating with other EdUni societies.

We provide a safe space for all those identifying as LGBT+ to socialise, discuss issues and be involved with the general LGBT+ community. Furthermore, we have various officers (just check out our committee page) who provide advice and support as well as holding their own platform of information, discussion and social events subject to their particular sub-group within the society.

If you have any queries or comments, please don’t hesitate to <a {% include links/email.html %}>email us</a> or get us on <a {% include links/facebook.html %}>Facebook</a>.
